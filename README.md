# CreaturesVsPreachers
Diploma project. A 2D topdown zombie defence game.

## How to run
Inside the export folder is an exe, run it. (It is better to run it from terminal to see error log)

For this version there are no tutorials or indicators, so this README will serve as such.

WASD - movement
M1 - shoot
Q - first ability
E - second ability
R - manual reload

Choose the magic staff after wave one to get an ability, since there are no abilities for the smg.
